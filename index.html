        <h2>Inspirations</h2>

        <p>Reading Stephen Jay Gould’s Full House changed how I think about biology: people are not simply data points, but individuals with unique vulnerabilities. This perspective drives my interest in a broad range of issues, both human and environmental. As a volunteer at <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/" target="blank" >Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>, my work has sparked my interest in how biology aids conservation. Furthermore, discussing marine conservation with young visitors to the aquarium reminds me why I love biology. It reinforces why I am so passionate about advancing research that could change our lives and the world around us.</p>

        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>

        <p>My academic journey has been defined by a desire to understand the role of genetics in disease. I worked with researchers and Dr. Michael Clague during a paid internship at the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/systems-molecular-and-integrative-biology/" target="blank" >University of Liverpool's Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology</a>, where my job was to purify proteins for use as research reagents. I transfected bacteria with plasmid DNA, induced that DNA’s expression using IPTG, and purified the resulting proteins with affinity chromatography. I focused on proteins such as BNIP3L, which may promote mitophagy in Parkinson’s, and BPJos, a deubiquitinase that could prevent degradation of beneficial proteins. These proteins were used in my own experiments, such as assaying BPjos’s ability to cleave ubiquitin chains, and in further disease and electron microscopy studies. Furthermore, to gain more hands-on lab experience, I also took a biomedical course at BioGrad, Liverpool, where it was exciting to see theoretical concepts applied in a real-world lab setting.</p>

        <h2>Extracirricular Activities and Interests</h2>

        <p>Outside academics, I love swimming and have been a varsity swimmer for all four years of high school and a year-round club athlete. I have also studied piano since I was three, and I am completing the <a href="https://www.mtac.org/programs/cm/" target="blank" >Music Teacher's Association of California Certificate of Merit</a> Advanced (10th) Level. Maintaining solid academics with my daily swim and piano practice has taught me time management and a disciplined approach. My experience on a French exchange, where I attended high school in Nevers and lived with a French family, was transformative. Exchanging ideas across cultures and studying overseas made me excited about the prospect of being an international student and taught me the value of sharing ideas.</p>
